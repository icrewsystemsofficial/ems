## Summer Internship 2021 - PHP Assignment 
# Event Management System

This is a basic folder structure for the php assignment. The reason why we've made this is, to 
let the interns / junior developers know what we expect to see when they turn in their projects. 

## Layouts

Since there are going to be a login system, use the "auth-layout.php" to code in the layout for your authentication pages. Use the "default-layout.php" for all the other pages. 


## Suggested Themes
1. [Boomerang UI](https://preview.webpixels.io/boomerang-free-bootstrap-ui-kit/)
2. [Tailwind Starter Kit by CT](https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/presentation)
3. [Argon Design System by CT](https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-design-system/index.html)

## How to go further? 
First, create a github account, and then clone this repository. Once done, checkout to your own branch. You MUST only push to your own branch. Along the process, you MUST update the changelog.md file of your project the milestones / features you've achieved with your projects.

## Required Pages 
1. Home page (for unauthenticated users)

3. Login Page
4. Signup Page

## Key features (MUST HAVE)

3. Should use a third party API (fullcalendar.io)

## Features (would be nice to have)
1. A profile page, where user can update their details. 
2. Sharing events on social media using "share" buttons.
